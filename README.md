## Step-Time Measurement

The file `Methodology_Steptime_2024-11-08_12-39-52.csv` contains the step-time data used in our experiments.  

The file `Review_Steptime_Evolution_Over_Time_Graphs.ipynb` is a Google Colab notebook that plots all of the results collected in the dataset.  

To execute the notebook, the only modification required is in Section 2: **Load Dataset**, where you must specify the path to the `.csv` file in your Google Drive.
